# Copernicus

You've reached the poorly written physics calculator, Copernicus, written by yours truly. Note that this not complete, which is why this calculator is going up here on GitHub, that way anyone can work on it and turn into the ultimate calculator.

Compilation is ridculously simple; there are no dependencies and it's all written within the C standard library. The command is simple too:

`gcc phy_calc.c -o phy_calc`

Then you can run the program as follows:

`./phy_calc`

This works with both GCC and Clang compilers and works with both Linux and FreeBSD (I'm sure Windows and Mac OS X work too, I just haven't tried them yet, I'm poor...)

I am a budding programmer and still learning by my own motivation. If you find anything (bugs, improvements, etc.), email me which can be found [here.](https://github.com/wymillerlinux)

Note: the man page (phycalc_man.txt) is supposed to be the Manual, I couldn't figure out how to place the Manual in there in a fashion like `less` or something of that matter
