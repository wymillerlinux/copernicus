MANUAL FOR MILLER PHYSICS CALC

Hello and welcome to the manual for my physics calculator. I, Wyatt Miller, will guide you through
on how to use this calculator. It's really simple and you shouldn't have any trouble working with
said calculator.

The calculator goes by a number system. What I mean by number system is that you'll see something
like this:

1. Calculate
2. Convert
3. Manual
4. About
5. Quit
ENTER A NUMBER:

You enter a number corresponding to the option.

What comes up as you start the calculator is the main menu of the calculator, as shown above. 
You choose what you want the calculator to do. For example, you enter the number 3, you encounter this
lovely here manual! How neat is that?

When the calculator tells you enter a number that has to do with an equation, like this:

Enter the given distance in meters: 

Just type the given number on your homework, lab, whatever it maybe. The answer will spat out
at you in a floating decimal. Don't worry if you don't means, it just means a decimal with six
decimal places. For example:

Total calculated velocity in meters per second: 140.231003

When you enter a number that isn't on the list, the program will return you back to the main menu.
I find it annoying when you have to do something that's really tedious. Just me though...

To exit this manual, press Ctrl+C to head back to the main menu!
